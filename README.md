# VivaldiRedesign-v1-by-LePliex

Hello guys, I made a CSS design for Vivaldi. I try to design with the CSS file the browser so possible modern. If you have suggestions, then write it in the comments.

  In which version works the theme?
 
 A.: 3.3.2022.47 (Stable channel) (64-bit) [Created by a Windows PC]

  What is buggy/ not settable?

- setting the Corner rounding (it ruin the Address-bar)

- Sidebar (if you press "F4" (full-screen not affected))

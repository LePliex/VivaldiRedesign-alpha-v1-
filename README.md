# VivaldiRedesign-v1.3-by-LePliex

Hello guys, I made a CSS design for Vivaldi. I try to design with the CSS file the browser so possible modern. If you have suggestions, then write it in the comments.

  In which version works the theme?
 
 A.: 3.3.2022.47 (Stable channel) (64-bit) [Created by a Windows PC]

  What is buggy/ not settable?

- setting the Corner rounding (it ruin the Address-bar)

Version 1.3


- Fixed sidebar
- Fixed cursor at the speed dial
- Fixed search at the speed dial + a bit redesigned
- Active tab rounded (a bit)
- Fixed hover Vivaldi logo
- Redesigned History (vivaldi://history)

- rounded the google logos
- added more pointer cursor
- more rounded the address-bar
- fixed Search field (where the search engines are)
